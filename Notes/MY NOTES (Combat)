===COMBAT ALWAYS IN MEMORY -NOTES=====
*To help facilitate keeping combat module in memory permanently 
(in the AUX BSR) Instead of storing mob.special char sheet in 
aux BSR, store them in main memory swap, which frees up 
4 pages of AUX BSR.  Then swap out those 4 pages when inventory 
or spell module is loaded (assuming that everything work out as 
expected that the weapon shapes and darkness module no longer 
require disk loads).

*Also see notes on clipboard pad, it's the 3rd page from the top
of the pad, titled "Combat Speed Problem Analysis"

*Consider that if I can hold inventory and merchant transactions
to $9600-$BFFF instead of starting at $9000, then if combat
were stored permenantly in AUX BSR, then 
$2900-$2EFF		AUX Swap space expansion?? ($600 bytes)
$2F00-58FF			AUX Swap space ($2A00 bytes)
	

*Before choosing AUX BSR as the permenant location for combat,
consider if any routines in main BSR need to be accessed and if 
so if bridges can be made. Also, with at least PC
character sheet data in AUX BSR bank 1, and if combat ends up in
AUX BSR bank2, consider if any bridges are needed there. The existing code
for character sheets might already handle everythign needed. 
	
	
-Options to free up Combat module memory	
    *in addition to the **OPT** notes in the combat module, look at **OPT** notes in stats0 (SWAP.ROUTINES.Combat.stats_summary.ASM) 
	*(I think this is done) See "OVERHAUL **OPT** PLAN USING CONTROL TABLE" in stats0 for a way to possible reduce the size of stats0. It is described as borderline as to whether there would be material savings
		but it may be worth trying if I'm out of good options. 
	*See  **OPT** note in stats0 ".HEALTH_STATUS" about making the health status and gender codes sequential so a lookup table can be used. This would be a savings
		even if if I don't do the overhaul plan. 
		
	*Freeing up aux main memory will help find a new home for the weapon shape tables which in turn helps free up aux BSR for the combat module
		*(DONE) changing the day/night floor/street tile switch to a tile swap instead of a shape table swap may help this. And it needs to be
		 done anyway to support the extra day/night tiles Bill did in the castle and ruined castle
 
	
	*Reduce # of saved paths for pathfinder. 
		;currently I've budgeted for 16 pages of memory. 
		;I suspect the implication of reducing the # of saved paths is reducing the # of NPCs that can be in transit at the same time.
			I bet we can reduce this by a lot (maybe by half) and be okay from a design standpoint. To verify find out the max size of a single saved path. I think it's 1 page. 
		;See "Pathfinder: Saved NPC Paths" in memory map.
	
===SCROLL TEXT===

*defender distaction indicator (engaged with other defender, not engaged, enaged with defender)

*critical hit!, critical hit blocked! (use critical hit flag)
*you dodged!, mob dodged (use flag from to-hit routine)

'------ORIGINAL NOTES
Mike: have melee attacks and range attacks do different damage for mobs


===TEXT===

*Show combat math
*Have info screen on mobs. Shows attack/defense stats on the player attacking the mob and mob attacking the player (like melee vs ragne attack damage)


==Issues==

*MTT can only move when onscreeen
	The options I can think of are:
		  a) The multi-tile mob won't be seen by the player until the player find it, and we just decide that is ok
		 b) We automatically have the multi-tile mobs start on the same screen as the player, even if the battlefield is actually much larger. There could be a quick exit key for the player to use when all mobs are defeated to leave the battlefield without having to walk to the edge
	(Mike: doesn't think it's a show stopper, ask him specifically how he'd approach this)

*The screen will need to recenter on each player
	*delay
	*disorienting?
	
==Features==

*Auto-targeting of the cross hairs


==OTHER

*missile weapons have ranges. If the next target in the cross hairs routine is 
beyond range then skip to next

==SPELL IDEAS / SPECIAL EFFECTS==

*throwing knife shape (or some other shape) opelts mob (or mobs) from a start position of the upper left corner of screen (or some other location). 
	Looked cool in a ranged weapon blooper. Could be called Ed's Axe of Anguish or something

*Close combat. Telports all players or all mobs the requisite distance so that the closest player
and closest mob are in melee range. Wrinkle: battle fields with collisions between players and mobs. 
Maybe move each player individually, assessing collisions along the way and stop on collision. 

*press key to abort projectile launch (at any time during launch), it then skips to hit/miss/impact

*generate Bill's storm. for sure does damange to anything touching. would be cool if it shot lighting to any target within X radius (probably need a routine that returns the MO record #s of any mobs within X radius of a given tile, for this and other things)
   and/or generate a bunch of storms that move horizontally accross the screen (top half). So mobs get periodically zapped until/if they can make there way to the lower half of the screen. This method seems workable even if the damage is only done when the storm moves onto the mob.
*hurricane wind
another spell idea. some kind of hurricane wind spell. it blows a random #of mobs off the screen, killing them. So the affected mobs would, at the same time, rapidly move backwards until off the screen. or maybe even move randomly up/left/right until off the screen. mobs flying everywhere!
Need to consider what happens if the blown back mobs hits an unaffected mob. 

*Mike suggested an earth/fire/wind/water thing. we've got wind and fire. .maybe a landslide for earth, dump a bunch or rock tiles onto the screen, squishing the mobs. now just need one for water


*triple cross bow

*armageddon by the cows


*holy handgrenade (or something). thrown on one turn, explodes on next turn. ideally mobs flee from it until it explodes. 
*creeping vine or fire thats spreads a bit each turn. 

-Fireball Notes

*maybe the fire explosion from fireballs on some
spells should stay on screen for a few terms or for some spells
permenantly.

*cow fired as an animated non-angled projectile

*Lightning sphere

*Lightning bomb. Ligtning sphere or bolt that triggers an explosion like the fireball but the explosion is comprised of lightning sphere tiles. 

*Powerful lightning bolt/fireball (animated, non-angle) that can only be fired vertically or horizontally, and everything in that column/row is hit. 
    
*Smite: lightning bolt (animated, non-angled) fires from top of screen (so it's always verticle) to smite the target. 
    -maybe have storm cloud appear and source the lightning from the cloud


*Maybe fireball size increases with level, or several spells each with different size


*sound spells: like some kind of banshee screech. could just be a high pitched sound, but consider what our standard cast spell sound will be, assuming we have one. 

*magic missle (small white ball?)
*(DONE) flame arrow (orange version of cross bow bolt)

*death beam (non-targeted, directional, hits everthing in the row or column that it is pointed in,
shape is an all black tile). Maybe this could also be done with fire and lightning. 

*(DONE) rapid fire multiple lightning bolts (with trail?)

-Water Spels
	*water projectile (I'm thinking with trail) hits target and explodes like a fireball. Not sure how damage works. 
	*water wave. Direction based. all tiles in direction spell is cast, possible in a tile-edged cone shape, becomes water. Not sure how damage would work. 

*summoning spells

-non-damage spells

*teleport player and/or mob

*some kind of blast
knocks a single mob back (x-y) tiles, doing some damage per tile the mob is blown backward. 
Need to consider what happens if the blown back mobs hits an unaffected mob. 


-spell related artifacts

*resist fire
*resist lightning
*resist death magic


====FINAL EFFECT SPELL LIST===


(done) fireball -no trail	

lightning -no trail, (if speeding it up looks good)
(done) lightning -trail	

(done) fire lightning -trail	
		;maybe call this infernal blast, or something where lightning isn't in the word
		
mass death

armagedon by the cows

summon demon lord


-Fleeing

I never liked how fleeing from combat in U4/U5 resulted in the mob disappearing from the surface map, making it possible to avoid battle with basically everyone.

What do you think of making it so that fleeing successfully from battle results in the player back on the map next to the mob, or maybe the mob is a couple tiles away, with it then being the players turn?

If the player can get away on the surface/town/undermap from there, fine. Sometimes, having a few more turns could make the difference and the player gets away. Sometimes the player may be cornered and so be it.

(Mike agrees)




=====TECHNICAL NOTES====

The chapter about color shapes on color backgrounds starts at p. 276. P.281 talks a bit about color backgrounds. 

Also take a look at Michael Porehskus suggestion about EOR for sprites, on the original pre-alpha posted to google groups.
