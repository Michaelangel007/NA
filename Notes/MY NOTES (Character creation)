*add hands (fists) (item type $00, item code $00) and skin (item type $01, item code $00) to player inventory with a quantity equal to the number of players in the party. 
	*when players are added/removed to the party, adjust the quantity of hands/skin in the player inventory. 

*For all PCs, must set readied equipment table hands slots to "hands" (fists) for left hand (item type $00, item code $00) and to hand-in use for right hand. Which hand
actually doesn't matter, but the two different settings are needed so that the player only gets one attack when "hands" are readied and this gets
the other hand set to $03 which flows into how the ready/unready routine works. 
		*update player inventory
			*add the hands item to the player inventory and set the readied flags for the hands item for all players
			
			
			
;***INIT PLAYER INVENTORY DATA***	
;(current located at .INIT.INVENTORY in game_loop.ASM)	
;I think this eventually should go in the character creation routine
;so that the open record value gets set in the player inventory table. Note
that the above code doesn't address writing the data to the inventory file
;after init. The labels such as INV.PLAYER.INVENTORY.TEST_DATA.END probably also
;would be different too.

-Calculate stats for the first time via CALCULATE.COMBAT.STATS.PROCESS_ALL_ENTRANCE
		*Note: right now I'm assuming this is necessary. When the time comes, review the assumtion, which depends on 
		;the values in the character sheet when it's init. Maybe damage and TO-HIT and defense on the char sheet can be set to the 
		;corret values in the character creation module via a template or something. Basically, I'm thinking if]
		;PCs start with fists readied in left/right hand and skin readied in all other equipment slots, then damage and defense will be $00. The kicker might be if races gives bonuses
		;to something like DEX which could affect TO-HIT. But in that case, I could call 
		;CALCULATE.COMBAT.STATS.LEVELUP_ENTRANCE or even a special character cretion entrance which sets
		;both INV.RE.UPDATE_DAMAGE.FLA and INV.RE.UPDATE_DEFENSE.FLAGs to $00, which means
		;only DEX will be calculated since it runs always. 
		;Actually, regarless of race bonuses, all players will have a DEX value so that might
		;nececitate the stats calc for DEX at least. Unless the start DEX value is below a floor
		;for when DEX is effecitve. I don't rememebr if there is a floor. To find out just set a character
		;to the start DEX value and see if their TO-HIT is > !50 after the stats calc runs. 
		;
		;Note: this is all about avoiding the 4 second disk load for calc stats to run, if possible
