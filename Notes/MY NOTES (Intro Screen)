Assuming that $2000 becomes the hand-off address
where the bootloader expectes NOXARCH.MAIN to be
here is my plan:

Write the intro and any game settings menus
as part of the main game files (game.loop.ASM being the primary which has the includes),
at $A000-$BFFF. This space won't be used until after the game
is loaded and a module using the swap (like combat, inventory, merchant transactions) is loaded.
 
This solves the problem of trying to put the intro in the loader when the
the loader occupies the graphics memory ($0000-$5FFF), and solves the problem in a way
where the intro still gets clobbered when it is no longer needed (i.e. when the swap is used for the first time after launch)
