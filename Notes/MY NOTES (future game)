(ADDED TO GOOLGE DOCS) *Map object animation on/off based on bit flag setting in the MO record. 
	*example: drawing attack target hit shape. We want to pause to keep the hit shape on screen, 
	but we can't update screen animation during the pause or the S_ENTITY hit will get redrawn by 
	the animation update, erasing the target hit shape. There are probably other uses too.
