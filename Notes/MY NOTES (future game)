(ADDED TO GOOLGE DOCS) *Map object animation on/off based on bit flag setting in the MO record. 
	*example: drawing attack target hit shape. We want to pause to keep the hit shape on screen, 
	but we can't update screen animation during the pause or the S_ENTITY hit will get redrawn by 
	the animation update, erasing the target hit shape. There are probably other uses too. 
	

*See Tile Draw Speed in "MY NOTES (MEMORY, SPEED PLANNING)"


*Michael Pohreski suggested way points stored on disk and a flocking algorithm instead of A*. For some
reason the math didn't seem to work on that when Beth suggested it but now I'm not sure why.

4 waypoints * 2 byte (X,Y) * 32 NPCs per location * 16 locations = !4096 bytes of disk, and only !256 bytes per location. Since I'm using 
16 pages of memory to store saved Nox A* paths, this seems just fine.



-COMBAT
	*Add chance for defender to interfere with spell casting attack, if combatants are in melee range. This is already setup for range weapons.
