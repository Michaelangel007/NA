I think that the inventory system is
the only module that needs to have access to the stats
for everything: i.e tables for weapons, armor, other items, mobs, etc. 

In the inventory module, when equipment is readied, then the stats for it are recorded
on the character sheet.

In the combat module:

at the start, load in the mob table, populate the combat mob array with mob stats, then let the mob table get clobbered

For the characters, just load the character sheets. The combat module 
only needs to know about the equipment that is readied.

Changing equipment during combat, if permitted, goes through the inventory module which
updates the character sheet

Use item might be a command with it's own module, in which it would be aware of various item stats tables.
