--General screen--

(DONE) *center top/Bottom border line with text

(DONE) *center text with map, not screen

(DONE) *put space before/after text so lines don't touch

(DONE) *replace text with line when a text window is displayed such as npc talk


--NPC Talk--

(DONE) *reserve a couple lines at bottom for player prompt and a few lines text

(DONE) *the main text window bottom row will be just able this area with the prompt

(DONE) *the main text are will scroll and support page breaks


--Stats/Inventory--

Also see "Player Info: stats, inventory etc." item on the game sheet. I think that info was earlier.

*Menus/tabs 
			*Press tab key to bring up menus
			*would be on the top line of the screen left to right
			*tab key or arrow keys to move between menus, shown by highlighting the active menu
			*return key to select menu
			
*The contents of each menu is displayed 
	in a text window on left side of screen. 
	This way a merchant conversation can go on via the right side text window
	and stats can be open on the left. Essentially the tab key should still trigger
	the overhead menus, even when talking to an NPC. need to imbed this into the keyboard scan of the input function. If tab key, then xyz
	
-From item on game sheet
Static info strip on right side (4 text chars wide): gold, food, health for 7 characters.

Extended info: Press tab displays labels in static info strip (i.e. characters, pack, stats, spells, etc), use arrow keys to select a label, which then displays the info in an expanded info window.

We talked about a window that pops out from the 4 character right side strip which
contains more information. I'm not sure what info it was going to be but probably more basic info on the players
like name, numerical HP, numerical MP, etc

Tentative decision for gold qty to be numerical value and to based the games economy on 9999 gold being a metric ass-load, or at least an english-unit ass load.

Tentative decision on food being a graphical icon to show qty, but undecided the specifics.

Possibly alert pop-ups if player runs low on food or health.

--Combat--

*Right side text window

See comments at top of COMBAT.UPDATE.TEXT_WINDOW

*Active player pop-out window. Maybe have a window pop-out further into the screen with right side text window
with more info on active player. In particular this was a solution for displaying a weapon name longer than !13 chars.
An alternate to that solution was to split the weapon name into two !13 character fields and print it on two lines in the right side window.  


*solutions for displaying long weapon names
(see Active player pop-out window above)


Multi-Screen Combat
	*Small, couple line, text window in lower left and/or upper right for things like: character name, readied weapon, and the command prompt, and the summary of attack results 
	*We also talked about the 4 char wide text window that currently has gold, can be used to display the active character HP, MP, etc. 
	
	
Single-Screen Combat
	*Just do a text window like for npc talk. The player won't be at the center of the screen
    because in a single screen combat, the sprites will move on the map rather than the map moving around the screen.
