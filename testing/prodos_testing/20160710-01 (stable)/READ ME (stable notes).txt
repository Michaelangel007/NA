This driver could likely have been used for the entire Nox Archist Game. The only issue with it was a very obscure 
CFFA virtual port bug (see notes below), and I asked Peter to add a feature to allow for reading in partial files.
His doing that increased the driver size by 2 pages and significantly changed the procedures for calling it. 

For an example and documentation of this version, see C:\My_Code\Examples\6502 ASM Examples\ProDOS\pdriver\Version (20160710-01) for 


Fully tested on:

Real Floppy
Mame
AppleWIN/floppy
AppleWIN/HD
CFFA/hard Drive

Virtual2/floppy


Problems with:


CFFA/floppy: breaks at random address if CFFA is physically in slot 7 with virtual Disk ][ on slot 5. This problem
was resolved with one of the versions between 20160725-01 and 20160802-02, probably the last one.
However, whichever one it was, I didn't test it other than to verify the CFFA port fix so other problems may have
crept in.
