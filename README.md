*repository files must be in C:\MY_CODE\NA for the project to build
*Requires SBASM cross-assembler. I have it installed in c:\SBASM
*Requires AppleCommander installed in C:\AC1.3.5
*Requires QB64. I have it installed in C:\QB64
*The build batch files are not currently in the repository. I need to move them from C:\SBASM to C:\MY_CODE\NA so they will be in the reposintory.
