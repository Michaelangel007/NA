Move south once and observe the screen shaking effect

I discovered this early in animation testing, when hard coding the animation for a single tile (flag).

The two frames are cycled via a page flip. To support this I created PAGE.MIRROR, which is called
right after DRAW.SCREEN.

In this version I didn't implement PAGE.MIRROR after the movement routines. Thus, the screen looks
fine on lauch because Hi-Res Page 1&2 are mirrored. After moving, the screen scrolls, thus 
making page1 and page2 != by 1 row or column. Thus, the page flip in the animation routine creates
the illusion of shaking the screen. 

**nOTE there is a bug in the PAGE.MIRROR used in this version. The stop address isn't being 
set correctly 

it is fixed by adding the following to the end of .PAGE1.CURRENTLY.FOREGROUND
	LDA #$60
	STA COPY.STOP.ADDRESS
