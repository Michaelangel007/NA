I'm don't remember off hand why thre are 3 shape files. At one point we were experiementng with making the battlements
wider so there wouldn't be a transition to the floor tile, thus reducing the number of day/night swap tiles needed but
it didn't look as good. Maybe one of the files was that setup.

I'm not sure if the map files correspond with these shape files or not, but they likely do.  


UPDATE (6/23/17); I'm pretty sure the 3rd spreadsheet was from when we were experimenting with the transitions as noted above.
I moved it to the archive folder. The map files do correspond with the tile spreadsheets.
