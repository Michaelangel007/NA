section: Row A, Column A (top-left zone)

Has battlement walls with day floor tile, day roof surface, and day roof wall tiles


section: Row A, Column B (top-center zone)

Has battlement walls with night floor tiles, night roof surface, and night roof wall tiles


**NOTE: the roof walls have night versions for 3 of the 4 tiles because those roof wall tiles
contain some pixels of the roof surface as a transition. Since the roof surface changes color with day/night, the
roof wall tiles with the surface need to change too.
